  *Link Text Styling
      -Links should be permanently bold, not just on hover.
    *HTML Semantics
      -Footer: Wrap the attribution footer in a <footer> element.
      -Main Content: Place the main content within a <main> element.
      -Card Tagging: Use <article> or <section> for the card element.
      -Reference: Check the MDN HTML elements reference for guidance.
  *Relative Font Sizes
      -Use relative units (e.g., em, rem) for font sizes instead of pixels to ensure accessibility, allowing users to zoom in on text.
  *Relative Units
      -Apply relative units for all dimensions (widths, paddings, margins, gaps) to make the design more flexible.
  *Fixed Heights
      -Avoid using fixed heights. Prefer min-height if setting a height is necessary.
  *Viewport Height
      -Use min-height: 100dvh to ensure the container occupies the full viewport height. Check the meaning of viewport-based relative length units if unfamiliar.
  *CSS Variables
      -Use CSS custom properties instead of Sass variables for color values.
